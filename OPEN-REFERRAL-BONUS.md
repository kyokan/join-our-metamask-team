We want your help in finding the best possible person to join our team and help build a decentralized web that is accessible and empowering for everyone.

We will give you $3000 CAD if you help us find someone we end up hiring.

How this works:
- If you've encouraged someone to apply, and then they actually apply, you can send us an e-mail to let us know. We will confirm with your referral.
- Alternatively, you could introduce us to someone by e-mail.
- If we end up hiring them, and we+they are excited to continue working together after 3 months, we will reward you the referral bonus.
