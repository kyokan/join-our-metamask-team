Hi! This repo is dedicated to helping you or someone you know join the Kyokan-MetaMask team.

We are a small team working on/with/for [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to realize big visions for empowering the world to use and build on the decentralized web. MetaMask is an [ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/beginners/) wallet, localized cryptographic key store and provider of access to decentralized networks for browser based apps. With more that 1.1 million users, it is the most relied on solution for users and developers of apps built on top of the ethereum blockchain.

MetaMask's visions, and Kyokan-Metamask's goals in contributing to the project, extend beyond ethereum and blockchains. We are excited about the [growing movement](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/) of decentralized networks, protocols and technologies that can empower people to improve their online and offline lives and societies. We intend our work on/with/for MetaMask to contribute to this movement in as many ways as possible.

To this end, Kyokan-MetaMask leads front-end engineering for the MetaMask extension. Meanwhile, we also take major responsibility in areas such as devops, release management, automated testing and full-stack code review and maintenance.

We are a team of three, ready and eager to grow to a team of four. We are looking for someone who:
- has multiple years of production experience
- a passion for building with javascript
- experience planning technical work and owning feature development from start to finish
- takes initiative in helping their teammates, teams and products improve and succeed
- is looking to work with a self-managed team that values collective decision making
- will bring energy and passion to work on MetaMask and the broader technical solutions and visions we aspire to
- is based in Canada, in either Eastern, Atlantic or Newfoundland/Labrador time zones
