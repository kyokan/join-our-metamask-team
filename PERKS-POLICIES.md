## Some Perks and Policies

- Highly competetive salary 
- Budget for team member expenses and needs (learning, tech, conference participation, etc.) that is allocated according to collective team decision making processes
- This position is remote, with a caveat: we'd like to meet up in person about once a quarter. We have budget for travel, room and board for the whole team, assuming this is taking place within Eastern Canada (i.e. Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, PEI, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador).
- Working hours
    - We generally work in Eastern time zone hours. This is not required, but we do hope to have a decent overlap in working hours with you
    - We have meetings every day from 1:00-1:45pm Eastern.  You should attend a majority of these each week
    - Work hours are flexible. Examples:
        - Sometimes one of us might not work in the morning, but work at night
        - Sometime one of us might work on a Sunday instead of a Friday
        - Once a team member had a toddler with an ear infection who was awake throughout the night for 3 nights in a row. The team member switched their work schedule, working through the night (amidst the spurts of soothing the toddler) and slept during the days.
        - Sometimes we attend to errands or family needs in the middle of the day and make up those hours at other times
        - It is possible to work a majority of your hours at times that don't overlap with Eastern, provided you do enough overlap and we can have enough live meetings with you.
- we work as contractors and are paid monthly
- Our vacation policy is something like "Unlimited Vacation Days". But could perhaps more accurately be described as "We trust you to take as much time off as you need to do great work. We expect you to take time off when you need it to care for yourself, friends and family. You will never be shamed for taking more time off than others, and will be reminded to take time off if you forget to do so for an extended period of time."
